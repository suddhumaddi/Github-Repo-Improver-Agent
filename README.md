üöÄ GitHub Repo Improver Agent: Production-Ready
Project Overview
The GitHub Repo Improver Agent is the capstone project for the Agentic AI Developer Certification Program. It transforms the functional multi-agent prototype (Module 2) into a robust, production-grade system compliant with professional software standards.

The application automatically analyzes a public GitHub repository and generates structured, actionable suggestions for improving documentation, discoverability, and project clarity.

üõ†Ô∏è Module 3 Professional Enhancements
This system is enhanced with features required for operational excellence, security, and quality assurance:

Feature

Implementation

Module 3 Requirement

Resilience

Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff (in ContentImproverAgent) to prevent failure from transient LLM API network errors.

Operational Excellence

Guardrails

Input Validation (regex check on URL format in app.py) and Secure Environment Handling (.gitignore).

Security & Safety

Quality Assurance

Comprehensive Testing Suite (tests/test_agents.py) including Unit and Integration Tests for core functionality.

Test Coverage (70%+)

UX Improvement

Streamlit UI (app.py) enhanced with clear logging and graceful handling of agent failures.

User Interface

üß† System Architecture and Agent Flow
The system utilizes a sequential LangGraph pipeline for controlled collaboration.

Agent

Core Task

Required Tools

1. RepoAnalyzerAgent

Repository Preparation. Clones the public target repo (using OS temporary directory to avoid permissions issues), performs Text Chunking, and initializes the RAG Retriever.

Repo Reader (gitpython), RAG Retriever (FAISS).

2. MetadataRecommenderAgent

Keyword & Tag Extraction. Identifies key topics and technical terms.

Keyword Extractor (nltk).

3. ContentImproverAgent

Structured Generation. Synthesizes suggestions, enforcing a Pydantic structure, with built-in Retry Logic for API stability.

LLM API (OpenRouter/GPT-4o Mini).

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications
I. Setup and Installation Instructions
Prerequisites: Ensure Python 3.10+ and the Git Command-Line Tool are installed.

Clone the Repository and install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Secure Configuration: Create a .env file for your OPENROUTER_API_KEY. (The repository's .gitignore automatically prevents this file from being pushed.)

NLTK Data: Download required NLP resources:

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"

II. RAG and Quality Assurance
Setting

Value

Rationale

Test Coverage

70%+

Achieved via Unit and Integration tests in the tests/ directory.

Text Chunk Size

1000

Maintains contextual integrity for code and documentation.

Text Chunk Overlap

200

Ensures semantic continuity for RAG retrieval.

Embedding Model

HuggingFaceEmbeddings(all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Fast, local embedding for efficient RAG index creation.

III. Running the System
Launch the App: Run the Streamlit UI (use Administrator mode for best results):

python -m streamlit run app.py

Run Tests (Verification): To verify core functionality and resilience:

python -m unittest tests.test_agents
